This was a fun exercise. Haven't worked on drizzle before. Impressed.

Did some frontend UI fixes. Used ShadCN table component.
modularized the home component into a few files.
Migrated the DB to use pg_trgm and full text search.
The route.ts file is a bit busy. Ran out of time to think of a better way to organize it (single transaction?)
